class Game:

    """Handle the game mechanics which are not related to location on the board.
    
    The game class handles all mechanics which are non-spatial; the latter are handled by the grid class. 
    Processes which are handled by the game class are:
    - the player assignments and the status thereof
    - player turns
    - player cores
    - ownership of objects
    - resource drawpiles
    - moving resources between player objects
    - burning resources for extra movement
    - determined whether the game is over
    
    Input:
    - config: a configparser object containing the keys of the Config.ini file
    - grid: reference to the grid object which manages the location-based game mechanics
    - visualiser: reference to visualiser object which handles all i/o
    
    Functions:
    - activate_player: activates a specified player
    - boat_select_fuel: selects fuel card to use for moving a boat and update move parameter and visualisation
    - check_assignment: checks whether selected resources fulfill the player's tier1 or tier2 assignments
    - deactivate_player: updates a player's point count and de-highlight his/her pawns in case not all were used     
    - end_player_turn: ends the active player's turn by activating the next player
    - fulfill_tier1: fulfills the requirement of the player's tier1 assignment by removing the appropriate resources 
    - fulfill_tier2: fulfills the requirement of the plyer's tier2 assignment by removing the appropriate resources
    - game_over: checks whether the game's end conditions have been reached.
    - get_current_player: returns a reference to the object of the current player
    - quit: Cleans up the generated card config files and kills the program
    - shift_resources: Moves selected resources from one stakck to another.
        !!! The checkboxes are interface specific, move (part of) function to visualiser
    - update_card_counts: Initiates updating the visualization of the card counts of the resource drawpiles.
    - update_points: Calculates all player scores, stores them and updates the visualisation.
    
    The following functions are run during __init__ to generate the resource draw decks:
    - get_required_resources: calculates resource requirement of the all player assignments
    - adjust_resources: adjusts resource requirement determined by get_required_resources as specified in config
    - get_resource_matrix: constructs a list of card names and the matrix with the number of each resource in it
    - calculate_resources: calculate the number of each resource card needed    
    - gen_res_conf: generates the resource config files of each landscape type as calculated using calculate_resources
